## Introduction - About the Project
The Hemisferios' Web System is a software project I had the opportunity to work on for my final internship program at the university. Here, I worked on a unified system that comprehends a website and an appointment system (for administrators only) for Hemisferios, a clinical center that offers language and communication therapy for children.


In this page, you can find the documentation for the backend functionality of the project, which contains an exhaustive explanation of the following elements:
* Installed dependencies.
* Setup of the backend environment, from start to finish.
* Creation and setup of the MongoDB's database.
* Schemas, modules, and endpoints for the client to consume.
